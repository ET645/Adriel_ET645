## Layout

Each folder is a mini-project all done in python with Pytorch library for Neural Networks/Deep Learning.

Assuming that you have already python3 installed and is using Ubuntu distribution, follow the code on your terminal:

```python
sudo apt install python3-pip

pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv venv
